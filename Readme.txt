Script name: ip_addr_allocation.py
IMPORTANT NOTE: This script uses python 2.7 to execute the logic. Please do not run this on a python 3 machine. 

Steps to run the script: 
1. Install the ip address library for python. You can do so by running the command pip install ippaddress from the CLI of your linux machine. If you are using a windows machine, you will need to download the ipaddress library and place it into the libraries folder.
2. Place the script in a suitable directory or folder. 
3. Run the python script through the CLI by entering the command: "python ip_addr_allocation.py"
4. Enter the IP network address of choice. 
5. The code handles all possibilities of supernetting and subnetting with the most efficient utilization of address space. 
6. If you enter a class B address and request for hosts mode than the limit of that subnet, no output will be received. 
7. The program handles one network at a time. Should you need to use it for multiple networks, delete or save the subnet available list and subnet allocated list and re-run the program. 

File names generated by the program: 
Subnet_List_Assigned.txt : Holds the subnets that are assigned to the customers. 
Subnet_List: Holds the subnets that are still available to allocate in the network.
